#BankHotel

A creative visual website I built for a mock Hotel called BankHotel, Guests can book hotel rooms with custom specified preferences, Payment integration using Paystack API, an option to download a generated pdf copy containing all your booking Info, a multistep form. I paid particular attention to the performance, code reusability, UI while maintaining a seamless user experience.
